## Why to Play Solo

Sometime you might play solo vs squad in Pubg mobile as you don't have any good squad to play. 

You might be new to the game and don't have any friend yet.

If you want to survive alone make sure to land in safe are like school, rozhok and severny etc.

don't engage in any fight untill you have a proper cover and try to take 1v1 fight as it will help you to survive.

don't rush and let your enemies rush on you.
